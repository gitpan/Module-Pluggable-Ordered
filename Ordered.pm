=head1 NAME

Module::Pluggable::Ordered - Call module plugins in a specified order

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Foo;
    use Module::Pluggable::Ordered;

    Foo->call_plugins("some_event", @stuff);

	for my $plugin (Foo->plugins()){
		$plugin->method();
	}

Meanwhile, in a nearby module...

    package Foo::Plugin::One;
    sub some_event_order { 99 } # I get called last of all
    sub some_event { my ($self, @stuff) = @_; warn "Hello!" }

	sub _order { 99 } # I get listed by plugins_ordered() last

And in another:

    package Foo::Plugin::Two;
    sub some_event_order { 13 } # I get called relatively early
    sub some_event { ... }

	sub _order { 10 } # I get listed by plugins_ordered() early

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module behaves exactly the same as C<Module::Pluggable>, supporting all of
its options, but also mixes in the C<call_plugins> and C<plugins_ordered>
methods to your class. C<call_plugins> acts a little like C<Class::Trigger>; it
takes the name of a method, and some parameters. Let's say we call it like so:

    __PACKAGE__->call_plugins("my_method", @something);

C<call_plugins> looks at the plugin modules found using C<Module::Pluggable> 
for ones which provide C<my_method_order>. It sorts the modules
numerically based on the result of this method, and then calls
C<$_-E<gt>my_method(@something)> on them in order. This produces an
effect a little like the System V init process, where files can specify
where in the init sequence they want to be called.

C<plugins_ordered> extends the C<plugins> method created by
C<Module::Pluggable> to list the plugins in defined order. It looks for
a C<_order> method in the modules found using C<Module::Pluggable>, and
returns the modules sorted numerically in that order. For example:

	my @plugins = __PACKAGE__->plugins();

The resulting array of plugins will be sorted. If no C<_order> subroutine
is defined for a module, an arbitrary default value of 50 is used.

=head1 OPTIONS

The C<package> option can be used to put the pluggability into another
package, to be used for modules building on the functionality of this
one.

It also provides the C<only> and C<except> options.

     # will only return the Foo::Plugin::Quux plugin
     use Module::Pluggable::Ordered only => [ "Foo::Plugin::Quux" ];

     # will not return the Foo::Plugin::Quux plugin
     use Module::Pluggable::Ordered except => [ "Foo::Plugin::Quux" ];

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thank you to Simon Cozens for originally writing this module.

Thanks to Lars Thegler for indirectly alerting me to the fact that my POD was
horribly broken, for providing patches to make this module work with Perl
versions < 5.6, for maintaining the port up to version 1.3, and for allowing me
to take maintainership for versions 1.3 onwards.
